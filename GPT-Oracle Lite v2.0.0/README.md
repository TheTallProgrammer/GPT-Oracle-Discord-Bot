# 🤖 GPT-Oracle Discord Bot Lite v2.0.0 🚀

The GPT-Oracle Discord Bot Lite has undergone significant enhancements from the v1.0.0 version, bringing in several useful features while maintaining a streamlined and user-friendly interface. While the bot's primary function - leveraging the capabilities of advanced language models for interactive conversations - remains intact, it now offers new command functionality, local API key storage, and improved usability.

## 📌 What's New in v2.0.0

Here's a brief overview of the key enhancements that have been made in the v2.0.0 version:

- **Command Functionality**: In the previous version, the bot primarily operated based on simple text input. With the v2.0.0 update, the bot can now handle commands, making user interaction more intuitive and efficient.

- **Local API Key Storage**: This update introduces the `!save_key` command, which allows users to save their API key locally on their system, without the need for a database. Once saved, this key can be used for all subsequent interactions without the need to provide the API key for each input.

- **Reusability**: The saved API keys can be used across multiple sessions, offering a seamless user experience without the need to enter API keys repeatedly.

- **Ideal for Small Server or Single Users**: With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, the v2.0.0 version is a perfect fit for small servers or individual users seeking an interactive chatbot without the need for managing a database. 

## ⚠️ Security 

Please note that the Lite version stores the literal API key locally on the user's system. While it offers the benefit of simplicity and does not require a database, it's less secure than the Plus version. It's essential to ensure that your system is secure and that you're not sharing your API key or the file containing the key with others. Misuse of API keys can lead to unwanted requests or charges.

## 📖 Usage and Tips

The GPT-Oracle Discord Bot Lite Version is designed to be easy and straightforward to use. Interaction remains largely similar to previous versions, with the key addition of the `!save_key` command.


To make usage even more seamless, you can store your API key locally using the `!save_key` command. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Open a Direct Message (DM) with the bot. 

2. Type the command `!save_key` followed by your API key. For instance:

		!save_key abcdef123456


3. Press Enter to send the message. The bot will store your API key locally on your system, eliminating the need to enter it each time you want to interact with the bot. 

Now, your API key is ready for all future interactions without needing to repeat the process. Please remember to handle your API key with care as it is sensitive information.

Please note that you need to replace `abcdef123456` with your actual API key. Always ensure that your API key is secure and not shared or exposed. For any further assistance, please reach out to the developer.

To interact with the bot, simply use the `!ask` command followed by your query. For example:

	!ask What is the meaning of life?
