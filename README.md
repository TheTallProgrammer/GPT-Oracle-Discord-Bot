# 🤖 GPT-Oracle Discord Bot: Lite vs Ultra 🚀

Welcome to the GPT-Oracle Discord Bot family. Designed to harness the powerful capabilities of cutting-edge language models, these AI-driven chatbots come in two variations: Lite and Ultra. Each has been meticulously crafted to serve diverse user needs and contexts.

## 🎚️ Lite Version

The GPT-Oracle Lite is simplicity personified. It's your go-to AI-powered chatbot for smaller servers or individual use cases, eliminating the need to manage a database.

### Key Features of the Lite Version

- **Streamlined Command Functionality**: The bot processes direct user commands for effortless and efficient interactions.
- **Local API Key Storage**: Save your API key directly on your system using the `!save_key` command. Reuse it across sessions without reentering.
- **Optimized for Small Servers or Single Users**: Built with a focus on ease and efficiency, the Lite version presents a straightforward AI chatbot solution for smaller deployments.

### ⚠️ Security Notice for Lite Version

In the Lite version, the API key is stored locally on your system. While this makes usage straightforward, it's not as secure as the Ultra version. It's essential to maintain system security, prevent API key exposure, and refrain from sharing the API key or its storage file.

## 🎛️ Ultra Version

The GPT-Oracle Ultra is a powerhouse designed for scalability and performance. It's the perfect AI chatbot solution for larger servers or when multiple users interact simultaneously.

### Key Features of the Ultra Version

- **Advanced Command Functionality**: Like its Lite counterpart, the Ultra version accepts direct user commands, promoting seamless interaction.
- **Remote SQL Database for API Key Storage**: The Ultra version houses API keys in a remote SQL database set up by the user. This feature allows for concurrent management of multiple API keys, making it perfect for larger servers and multi-user situations.
- **Engineered for Large Servers or Multiple Users**: The Ultra version's scalability and robust database management make it an ideal AI chatbot solution for larger deployments.
