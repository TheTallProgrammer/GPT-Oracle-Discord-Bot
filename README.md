# 🤖 GPT-Oracle Discord Bot: Lite vs Plus 🚀

The GPT-Oracle Discord Bot is a highly customizable, AI-driven chatbot that leverages the capabilities of advanced language models to facilitate engaging conversations. It comes in two flavors: Lite and Plus. Each version has been developed to cater to different user requirements and use-cases.

## 🎚️ Lite Version

The Lite version is designed for simplicity and ease-of-use. It is ideally suited for small servers or individual users looking for an AI-powered chatbot without the hassle of managing a database.

### Key Features of the Lite Version

- **Simple Command Functionality**: The bot accepts direct commands from users, making interactions intuitive and efficient.
- **Local API Key Storage**: Users can save their API key locally on their system using the `!save_key` command. Once saved, the key can be reused across multiple sessions without the need for repeated input.
- **Ideal for Small Servers or Single Users**: With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, the Lite version provides a streamlined, efficient chatbot solution for small-scale applications.

### ⚠️ Security Notice for Lite Version

The Lite version stores the API key locally on the user's system. While this simplifies usage, it is less secure than the Plus version. It is crucial to ensure the security of the system where the API key is stored and to avoid sharing the API key or the file containing the key with others.

## 🎛️ Plus Version

The Plus version is developed with scalability and robustness in mind. It is perfect for large servers or applications that require multiple users to interact with the bot concurrently.

### Key Features of the Plus Version

- **Command Functionality**: Like the Lite version, the Plus version accepts direct commands from users, enabling seamless interaction.
- **Remote SQL Database for API Key Storage**: The Plus version stores API keys in a remote SQL database set up by the developer using the bot. This feature allows the bot to manage multiple API keys concurrently, ideal for large servers and multi-user scenarios.
- **Ideal for Large Servers or Multiple Users**: With its focus on scalability and robust database management, the Plus version provides a powerful chatbot solution for large-scale applications.
